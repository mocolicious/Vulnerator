		<ImplementationGuidance>The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents critical information system components by performing a criticality analysis for information systems, information system components, or information system services IAW DoDI 5200.44.  Information systems include all DoD Information Technology.

			Criticality analysis is the primary method by which a program identifies mission-critical functions and associated components. Criticality analysis includes the following iterative steps:
			1. Identify and group mission threads.
			2. Decompose the mission threads into their mission-critical functions and assign them criticality levels.
			3. Map the mission-critical functions to the system architecture and identify the defined system components (hardware, software, and firmware) that implement those functions (i.e., components that are critical to the mission effectiveness of the system or an interfaced network).
			4. Allocate criticality levels to those components that have been defined.

			Criticality levels are determined by assessing the relative impact on the system’s ability to complete its mission if the function and associated component fails. Level I is total mission failure, Level II is significant/unacceptable degradation, Level III is partial/acceptable, and Level IV is negligible.

			Once the program has identified critical components through the criticality analysis, the program systems engineers and SSEs can use the results along with the vulnerability assessment and threat assessment to determine the risk.
