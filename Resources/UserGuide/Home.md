# Welcome to the Vulnerator wiki!

In addition to shipping the user guide for the software with the software itself, this will be kept up to date with how-to information and all of the latest and greatest features and enhancements.  If, while reading here, you come across an issue or a feature enhancement that you would like to see, please feel free to head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/Vulnerator/Vulnerator/issues) page to drop us a note; alternatively, if you are code-inclined, you can always feel free to fork the repository and muddle through the mess that [Alex](https://github.com/amkuchta) has made of the application.

## The Mission

Vulnerator has been designed to assist U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity analysts with the daunting task of consolidating vulnerability data from the numerous sources that have been mandated:

* The Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS)
* Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)
* Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) content parsed via ACAS or the SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC)<sup>1</sup>
* Windows Automated Security Scanning Program (WASSP)  

---
<sup>1</sup>Parsing from additional sources is envisaged

The above having been said, many more features are imagined and currently in development for later releases of the software; for a full detail of what lies ahead, please refer to the [Looking Ahead](https://github.com/Vulnerator/Vulnerator/wiki/Looking-Ahead) page.
